</div>

A simple 2D space combat game developed using Java and Swing. Be the captain, shoot down enemy fleet ships and upgrade your ship.

_The game was developed in 2023 in the first year of computer science as a course project. All the game graphics are based on the manipulation of ordinary images.
There are no plans to continue development but I am ready to accept any suggestions._

>**PS:** Don't judge strictly by the code, I'm in shock myself.

After each repulsed attack on you, you can improve your ship with various boosters. To do this, you need to choose a booster from the ones offered to you.
There are several levels of improvements in the game. The first and second levels drop randomly, and the third is given after defeating the boss.
